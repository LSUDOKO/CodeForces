# CodeForces Solutions Repository

Welcome to the **CodeForces Solutions** repository! This repository is dedicated to storing and organizing my solutions to various problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), a popular competitive programming platform.

## 📚 About

This repository serves as a personal archive of my progress, practice, and learning on Codeforces. Here you will find my solutions to problems of varying difficulties, written in different programming languages according to the problem requirements or my learning goals.

## 🗂️ Structure

The repository is organized by problem or contest, with each folder or file named according to the problem's code or contest number. Solutions are typically written in C++, Python, or Java, but you may find other languages as well.

Example structure:
```
├── contest1234/
│   ├── A_Solution.cpp
│   ├── B_Solution.py
├── 158A_Next_Round.cpp
├── 4A_Watermelon.py
...
```
